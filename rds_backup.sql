Welding is distinct from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal.\\n\\n- It is classified into two groups: fusion welding, which uses heat alone or pressure welding, which uses heat and pressure.\\n\\n- There are several types of fusion welding including electric arc, gas, and thermit. Electric arc welding is the most commonly used type and it uses an electric arc to melt the base and filler metals.\\n\\n- Other common methods are Gas or oxy-fuel welding which uses a flame to melt metal and Oxy-fuel and plasma cutting which involve the melting of metal and the generation of airborne metal fume. \\n\\n- During welding, precautions should be taken to avoid health hazards like electric shock, fire, explosion and exposure to toxic fumes.\\n\\n- Welding requires skills and proper training as it is commonly used to fabricate or repair parts in various industries like automotive, construction and manufacturing.\\n\\nI hope this information was helpful.

Always ensure safety: Whether you are using nails or glue, ensuring safety by clamping and securing the wood pieces is essential. Use the right tools for clamping and wear personal protective equipment, such as safety glasses and gloves.\\n\\n2. Selection of nails: Make sure the size and type of the nails are appropriate. If unsure, seek advice or refer to the manual/guide provided. Always pre-drill holes if the nails are too large to avoid damaging the wood.\\n\\n3. Using wood glue: Preparation is key. The surfaces to be glued must be clean, dry, and smooth for an effective bond. Apply an even layer of the adhesive and avoid using excess glue as it can weaken the bond.\\n\\n4. Drying and Curing: After applying the glue or inserting the nails, let them dry or cure as per the recommended time. Rushing this process can result in a weakened connection.\\n\\n5.

Mark and align both pieces accurately before starting.\\n2. Always pre-clamp and secure your wood pieces for better alignment and stability.\\n3. For large nails, pre-drill a hole to guide your nail; it will decrease the chances of splits or cracks.\\n4. Sink your nail head a bit under the surface to provide a neat finish and better adherence.\\n5. Never force a nail into your wood, it can cause damage or weaken the connected spot.\\n\\nUsing wood glue - \\n1. Prepare the wood surface by sanding it and cleaning the dust off before applying glue for better adherence.\\n2. Apply an even, thin layer of glue on both surfaces to be connected.
